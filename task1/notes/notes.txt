About implementation using bitwise operators:

- For unsigned integers greater than 2 ** 31 - 1 the bitwise operators won't work properly (sign bit etc).
JS numbers are 64bit numbers.

- Function reverseBinary needs to work with numbers up to 2 ** 64, so its input parameter 
must be converted to a BigInt with a 64bit length.

- Integers are safely represented by 53 bits:
